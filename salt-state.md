create `/srv/salt` directory if it doesn't exist

create a new salt state called nettools.sls as `/srv/salt/nettools.sls`:

```bash
install_network_packages:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - rsync
      - lftp
      - curl
```

On Salt master, run the following command to apply the nettools state to only one specified salt-minion:

```bash
salt 'salt-minion-2' state.apply nettools
```
or run the following command to apply the nettools state to all salt-minions:

```bash
salt "*" state.apply nettools
```
output would be something like this:


```bash
root@salt-master:/srv/salt# salt "*" state.apply nettools
